The structure of the macros folder is the following:
-[geo]->contains the macros to produce the geometries of HYDRA: prototype, FullBeamOut, FullBeamIn. These geometries are stored in the folder ../geometries.
-[sim]->contains the macros to run the simulation. simHYDRA.C(and run_simHYDRA) will produce 2 root files: [par.root] and [sim.root], this contains information about the parameters of the simulations and the particles information, respectively. To do so it requires as input the generator that is stored in the folder ../gtpgen/ASCII.
-[proj]->contains the macros to calculate the electron drift. To do so it requires as input the files produced in the sim folder and will produce in output the file [proj.root] that contains the information about the virtual pad plane and the electron drift. The drift can be done in 2 ways: simple projection, Langevin equation.
-[vis] contains the macros to visualize the projection of the particles drift onto the pad plane. To do so it requires the file [proj.root].
